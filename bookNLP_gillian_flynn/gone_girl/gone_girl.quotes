It emits a dying wail – coo - crrrrww – that every time brings Bleecker trotting in from some hideaway , eyes wild , all business , his tail a bottle - brush as he tilts his head toward the feathers and mewls .

I am the one ( the jobless ) at home all day , just waiting for its squawk , a tense moviegoer steeling myself for the next outburst from the crazy patron behind me – both relieved ( there it is ! ) and angry ( there it is ! ) each time it comes .

He had n’t been able to get her one ( ‘

80244	80274	80241	80241	Gilpin	194	‘ Both he and his mother deny that he ever stalked Amy , or that he even had much contact with her these past years except the occasional note . ’
80275	80330	80229	80229	she	225	‘ My wife would tell you differently . He wrote Amy for years – years – and then he shows up here for the search , Rhonda . Did you know that ? He was here that first day . You talked about keeping an eye out for men inserting themselves into the investigation — ’

80435	80477	80430	80430	I	0	‘ Inserting themselves into the investigation : David Samson , Murphy Clark – those are old boyfriends – Tommy O’Hara , Tommy O’Hara , Tommy O’Hara , that ’s three calls , Tito Puente – that ’s just a dumb joke . ’

80491	80527	80430	80430	I	0	‘ No . Is n’t that your job ? I do n’t know which are worthwhile and which are crazies . I do n’t have time to call some jackass pretending to be Tito Puente . ’
80528	80543	80544	80544	Rhonda	225	‘ I would n’t put too much emphasis on the tip line , Nick , ’
80547	80587	80544	80544	Rhonda	225	‘ It ’s kind of a woodwork situation . I mean , we ’ve fielded a lot of phone calls from your old girlfriends . Just want to say hi . See how you are . People are strange . ’
80588	80598	80599	80599	Gilpin	194	‘ Maybe we should get started on our questions , ’
80602	80623	80624	80624	Boney	225	‘ Right . Well , I guess we should begin with where you were the morning your wife went missing , ’
80671	80679	80649	80649	she	2977	‘ When I was at the beach . ’
80680	80692	80693	80693	Boney	225	‘ And you still ca n’t recall anyone seeing you there ? ’
80696	80715	80693	80693	Boney	225	‘ It ’d help us so much if we could just cross this little thing off our list . ’
80748	80770	80729	80729	she	225	‘ Believe me , I ’d like that as much as you . But no . I do n’t remember anyone . ’
80777	80832	80771	80771	Boney	225	‘ It ’s strange , we ’ve mentioned – just in passing – your being at the beach to a few people , and they all said … They were all surprised , let ’s put it that way . Said that did n’t sound like you . You are n’t a beach guy . ’
80836	80865	80833	80833	I	0	‘ I mean , do I go to the beach and lay out all day ? No . But to sip my coffee in the morning ? Sure . ’
80866	80873	80874	80874	Boney	225	‘ Hey , this might help , ’
80878	80888	80889	80889	She	2984	‘ Where ’d you buy your coffee that morning ? ’
80899	80910	80889	80889	She	2984	‘ Could tighten the time frame at least , right ? ’
80911	80917	80918	80918	I	0	‘ I made it here , ’
80921	80924	80925	80925	She	2984	‘ Oh . ’
80928	80961	80925	80925	She	2984	‘ That ’s weird , because you do n’t have any coffee here . Nowhere in the house . I remember thinking it was odd . A caffeine addict notices these things . ’
80989	80992	80971	80971	I	0	’re clearly phony …

81038	81046	81047	81047	We	2987	‘ Few days . Still tastes good . ’

81245	81250	81251	81251	Gilpin	194	‘ It looked wrong , ’
81254	81305	81306	81306	He	194	‘ From the second we saw it . To be honest , the whole thing looked staged . First of all , there ’s the fact that it was all centered in this one spot . Why was n’t anything messed up anywhere but this room ? It ’s odd . ’
81316	81348	81306	81306	He	194	‘ And look here , at this pile of books . They should be in front of the end table – the end table is where they were stacked , right ? ’
81352	81383	81390	81390	someone	5700	‘ So when the end table was knocked over , they should have spilled mostly in front of it , following the trajectory of the falling table . Instead , they ’re

81408	81420	81421	81421	Gilpin	194	‘ And watch this . This is very curious to me , ’

81572	81590	81591	81591	She	225	‘ But here ’s another thing . The ottoman – remember how it was flipped upside down ? ’
81610	81639	81591	81591	She	225	‘ See , this thing is bottom - heavy because of those tiny legs . The cushion practically sits on the floor . Try to push it over . ’
81643	81650	81651	81651	Boney	225	‘ Go on , try it , ’
81683	81701	81702	81702	Boney	225	‘ Seriously , get down there if you need to , and knock that thing upside down , ’
81757	81762	81763	81763	Boney	225	‘ Weird , huh ? ’
81772	81786	81787	81787	Gilpin	194	‘ Nick , you do any housecleaning the day your wife went missing ? ’

81896	81939	81893	81893	Gilpin	194	‘ Somehow , in theory , she made it into the kitchen – without disturbing any of those gewgaws on that table just outside the kitchen – and then she collapsed in the kitchen , where she lost a lot of blood . ’

But before we even get to the legal portion , we need to start dealing with public opinion , because the way it ’s going , we have to assume everything is going to get leaked : your credit cards , the life insurance , the supposedly staged crime scene , the mopped - up blood . It looks very bad , my friend . And so it ’s a vicious cycle : The cops think you did it , they let the public know . The public is outraged , they demand an arrest . So , one : We ’ve got to find an alternative suspect . Two : We ’ve got to keep the support of Amy ’s parents , I can not emphasize that piece enough . And three : We ’ve got to fix your image , because should this go to trial , it will influence the juror pool . Change of venue does n’t mean anything anymore – twenty - four - hour cable , Internet , the whole world is your venue . So I can not tell you how key it is to start turning this whole thing around . ’

96584	96653	96575	96575	Bolt	359	‘ Okay , we have to assume this is bad news for us . But you need to track them down .

Actually , do that , that ’s better . ’

You cooked her chicken soup when she was sick , or you sent her love letters while you were on a business trip . Nothing too flashy . I do n’t care about jewelry unless you guys picked it out on vacation or something . We need real personal stuff here , romantic - movie stuff . ’

97144	97161	97162	97162	he	3447	‘ Then I bet their theory is she wanted a gun to protect herself from you , ’
97165	97203	97162	97162	he	3447	‘ She was isolated , she was scared . She wanted to believe in you , yet she could feel something was very wrong , so she wanted a gun in case her worst fear was correct . ’

You will go to fucking prison . Now , the issue is to do it without turning her against us . Without leaving her with a vendetta , an urge to go public , anything but fond memories . Make her believe that this was the decent thing , make her want to keep you safe . How are you at breakups ? ’

99482	99521	99481	99481	I	0	’m not , not a bit , but for the past year I ’ve been saying I am . I told Nick probably half a dozen times how afraid I am of blood , and when he said , ‘

99551	99622	99543	99543	I	0	’ Nick has such a careless memory for other people ’s problems , he just assumed it was true . Swooning at the plasma center , that was a nice touch .

100268	100310	100267	100267	I	0	’m sure it was my father ’s suggestion – his optimistic impulse , his tie - dyed earnestness : We ca n’t give up hope , Marybeth . But give up Hope is exactly what they did , over and over again .

I would clamber onto my mother ’s lap , or thrust a crayoned drawing in her face , or remember a permission slip that needed prompt attention . My father would try to distract me , try to take me to a movie or bribe me with sweets . No matter the ruse , it did n’t work . I would n’t give my mother those few minutes .
101020	101030	100997	100997	I	0	’re too lazy or stupid to pull off a switch .

101210	101351	101195	101195	I	0	’re fooled because so many women are willing to pretend to be this girl . For a long time Cool Girl offended me . I used to see men – friends , coworkers , strangers – giddy over these awful pretender women , and I ’d want to sit these men down and calmly say : You are not dating a woman , you are dating a woman who has watched too many movies written by socially awkward men who ’d like to believe that this kind of woman exists and might kiss them . I ’d want to grab the poor guy by his lapels or messenger bag and say : The bitch does n’t really love chili dogs that much – no one loves chili dogs that much ! And the Cool Girls are even more pathetic : They ’re
101365	101383	101195	101195	I	0	’re pretending to be the woman a man wants them to be . Oh , and if you ’re

102569	102656	102565	102565	he	712	’re the coolest girl ever , but he ’s saying it because he got his way . He ’s calling you a Cool Girl to fool you ! That ’s what men do : They try to make it sound like you are the cool girl so you will bow to their wishes . Like a car salesman saying , How much do you want to pay for this beauty ? when you did n’t agree to buy it yet . That awful phrase men use : ‘
102669	102688	102667	102667	I	0	’ Yes , I do mind . Just say it . Do n’t lose , you dumb little twat .

103622	103634	103635	103635	Go	180	‘ If she ’s framing you , why let you know ? ’
103648	103676	103635	103635	Go	180	‘ Because she ’s done it so perfectly . She always needed that validation , the praise , all the time . She wants me to know I ’m

103764	103823	103761	103761	I	0	‘ That ’s the question , because whatever she assumes I ’ll do , whatever she wants me to do , I have to do the opposite . If she thinks I ’ll freak out and try to get rid of all this stuff , I guarantee you she has a way I ’ll get busted with it . ’
103824	103834	103835	103835	Go	180	‘ Well , you ca n’t leave it here , ’
103838	103861	103835	103835	Go	180	‘ You ’ll definitely get busted that way . Are you sure that was the last clue ? Where ’s your present ? ’

On my list was Write Diary Entries for 2005 to 2012 . Seven years of diary entries , not every day , but twice monthly , at least . Do you know how much discipline that takes ? Would Cool Girl Amy be able to do that ? To research each week ’s current events , to cross - consult with my old daily planners to make sure I forgot nothing important , then to reconstruct how Diary Amy would react to each event ? It was fun , mostly . I ’d wait for Nick to leave for The Bar , or to go meet his mistress , the ever - texting , gum - chewing , vapid mistress with her acrylic nails and the sweatpants with logos across the butt ( she is n’t like this , exactly , but she might as well be ) , and I ’d pour some coffee or open a bottle of wine , pick one of my thirty - two different pens , and rewrite my life a little .

112113	112198	112199	112199	I	0	’m a romantic . In real life , if Nick had killed me , I think he would have just rolled my body into a trash bag and driven me to one of the landfills in the sixty - mile radius . Just dispose of me . He ’d have even taken a few items with him – the broken toaster that ’s not worth fixing , a pile of old VHS tapes he ’s been meaning to toss – to make the trip efficient .
112200	112418	112199	112199	I	0	’m learning to live fairly efficiently myself . A girl has to budget when she ’s dead . I had time to plan , to stockpile some cash : I gave myself a good twelve months between deciding to disappear and disappearing . That ’s why most people get caught in murders : They do n’t have the discipline to wait . I have $ 10,200 in cash . If I ’d cleared out $ 10,200 in a month , that would have been noticed . But I collected cash forwards from credit cards I took out in Nick ’s name – the cards that would make him look like a greedy little cheat – and I siphoned off another $ 4,400 from our bank accounts over the months : withdrawals of $ 200 or $ 300 , nothing to attract attention . I stole from Nick , from his pockets , a $ 20 here , a $ 10 there , a slow deliberate stockpile – it ’s like that budgeting plan where you put the money you ’d spend on your morning Starbucks into a jar , and at the end of the year you have $ 1,500 . And I ’d always steal from the tip jar when I went to The Bar . I ’m
112466	112693	112465	112465	I	0	’m going to hide out long enough to watch Lance Nicholas Dunne become a worldwide pariah , to watch Nick be arrested , tried , marched off to prison , bewildered in an orange jumpsuit and handcuffs . To watch Nick squirm and sweat and swear he is innocent and still be stuck . Then I will travel south along the river , where I will meet up with my body , my pretend floating Other Amy body in the Gulf of Mexico . I will sign up for a booze cruise – something to get me out into the deep end but nothing requiring identification . I will drink a giant ice - wet shaker of gin , and I will swallow sleeping pills , and when no one is looking , I ’ll drop silently over the side , my pockets full of Virginia Woolf rocks . It requires discipline , to drown oneself , but I have discipline in spades . My body may never be discovered , or it may resurface weeks , months , later – eroded to the point that my death ca n’t be time - stamped – and I will provide a last bit of evidence to make sure Nick is marched to the padded cross , the prison table where he ’ll be pumped with poison and die .

His name , he says , is Jeff , just like my name , I say , is Lydia . We smile only in passing , but he brings me fish .

Andie is a good girl , meaning she does n’t post photos of herself ‘
113395	113446	113268	113268	she	324	’ and she never posts lascivious messages . Which is unfortunate .

You know those signs on the back of trucks : How Am I Driving ? She had me call and give them the license plate . I thought that was the end of it . Two months later – two months later – I walked into our bedroom , and Amy was on the phone , repeating that license plate . She had a whole story : She was traveling with her two - year - old , and the driver had nearly run her off the road . She said it was her fourth call . She said she ’d even researched the company ’s routes so she could pick the correct highways for her fake near - accidents . She thought of everything . She was really proud .

Dorothy has another gem taped to the wall by the soda machine , showing a toddler asleep on the toilet – Too Tired to Tinkle . I ’ve been thinking about stealing this one , a fingernail under the old yellow tape , while I distract - chat with Dorothy . I bet I could get some decent cash for it on eBay – I ’d like to keep some cash coming in – but I ca n’t do it , because that would create an electronic trail , and I ’ve read plenty about those from my myriad true - crime books . Electronic trails are bad : Do n’t use a cell phone that ’s registered to you , because the cell towers can ping your location . Do n’t use your ATM or credit card . Use only public computers , well trafficked . Beware of the number of cameras that can be on any given street , especially near a bank or a busy intersection or bodegas . Not that there are any bodegas down here . There are no cameras either , in our cabin complex . I know – I asked Dorothy , pretending it was a safety issue .

All her friends came in , explained how Amy for the past month had been so frightened of me . All this shit . I looked totally insane . Completely insane . Her parents got a restraining order on me . And I kept swearing it was n’t me , but by then I was so miserable that I wanted to leave school anyway . So we did n’t fight the expulsion . I wanted to get away from her by that time . I mean , the girl cracked her own ribs . I was scared – this little fifteen - year - old , she ’d pulled this off . Fooled friends , parents , teachers . ’

142764	142824	142761	142761	she	425	’ righteous . Two years ago , she took under her silken wing a young mother who had been imprisoned for shaking her infant to death . Sharon Schieber presented a whole legal – and very emotional – defense case over a series of nights . The woman is now back home in Nebraska , remarried and expecting a child .
142825	142841	142761	142761	she	425	‘ That ’s for sure . She got in touch after the video went viral . ’

142897	142911	142912	142912	Go	180	‘ Because last night it served an actual purpose : Get Amy back , ’

143198	143244	143245	143245	Tanner	359	‘ Sure , like a talking dog who does n’t want to go to prison . We get Sharon Schieber to take you on as a cause , Nick , and we are golden . This is all incredibly unorthodox , but that ’s me , ’
143285	143288	143289	143289	I	0	‘ What ? ’
143292	143317	143260	143260	He	359	‘ You need to tell Sharon Schieber about Andie – because it ’s going to come out , the affair , it just will . ’

143337	143457	143260	143260	He	359	‘ I swear to you , Nick – how many cases have I handled ? It always – somehow , some way , always comes out . This way we have control . You tell her about Andie and you apologize . Apologize literally as if your life depends on it . You had an affair , you are a man , a weak , stupid man . But you love your wife , and you will make it up to her . You do the interview , it ’ll air the next night . All content is embargoed – so they ca n’t tease the Andie affair in their ads . They can just use the word bombshell . ’
143458	143467	143260	143260	He	359	‘ So you already told them about Andie ? ’
143468	143474	143475	143475	he	4630	‘ Good God , no , ’
143478	143566	143475	143475	he	4630	‘ I told them : We have a nice bombshell for you . So you do the interview , and we have about twenty - four hours . Just before it hits TV , we tell Boney and Gilpin about Andie and about our discovery in the woodshed . Oh my gosh , we ’ve put it all together for you : Amy is alive and she ’s framing Nick ! She ’s crazy , jealous , and she is framing Nick ! Oh , the humanity ! ’
143567	143581	143260	143260	He	359	‘ Why not tell Sharon Schieber , then ? About Amy framing me ? ’
143582	143685	143475	143475	he	4630	‘ Reason one . You come clean about Andie , you beg forgiveness , the nation is primed to forgive you , they ’ll feel sorry for you – Americans love to see sinners apologize . But you can reveal nothing to make your wife look bad ; no one wants to see the cheating husband blame the wife for anything . Let someone else do it sometime the next day : Sources close to the police reveal that Nick ’s wife – the one he swore he loved with all his heart – is framing him ! It ’s great TV . ’
143686	143692	143260	143260	He	359	‘ What ’s reason two ? ’
143693	143722	143475	143475	he	4630	‘ It ’s too complicated to explain exactly how Amy is framing you . You ca n’t do it in a sound bite . It ’s bad TV . ’

143875	143912	143872	143872	Tanner	359	‘ Telling the police the whole story – Amy ’s framing Nick – it is a risk . Most cops , they decide on a suspect and they do n’t want to veer at all . They ’re

144023	144118	143984	143984	Go	180	’re a killer . I think she would be open to an alternate theory . She has a good reputation as a cop who ’s actually fair . As a cop who has good instincts . I talked with her . I got a good vibe . I think the evidence is leading her in your direction , but I think her gut is telling her something ’s off . More important , if we do go to trial , I would n’t use the Amy frame - up as your defense , anyway . ’

Nor house keys nor the gate security code . I am literally a prisoner – the gate is fifteen feet high , and there are no ladders in the house ( I ’ve looked ) . I could , I suppose , drag several pieces of furniture over to the wall , pile them up , and climb over , drop to the other side , limp or crawl away , but that ’s not the point . The point is , I am his valued , beloved guest , and a guest should be able to leave when she wants . I brought this up a few days ago . ‘

165266	165452	165457	165457	he	5166	’m not by myself , not that much . We have a bit of a routine established in just two weeks . It ’s a routine mandated by Desi , my posh jailer , my spoiled courtier . Desi arrives just after noon , always smelling of some expensive lunch he ’s devoured with Jacqueline at some white - linened restaurant , the kind of restaurant he could take me to if we moved to Greece . ( This is the other option he repeatedly presents : We could move to Greece . For some reason , he believes I will never be identified in a tiny little fishing village in Greece where he has summered many times , and where I know he pictures us sipping the wine , making lazy sunset love , our bellies full of octopus . ) He smells of lunch as he enters , he wafts it . He must dab goose liver behind his ears ( the way his mother always smelled vaguely vaginal – food and sex , the Collings reek of , not a bad strategy ) .

165826	165872	165815	165815	He	272	‘ Would n’t it be so lovely to just forget about Nick , those awful five years , and move on ? You have that chance , you know , to completely start over with the right man . How many people can say that ? ’

Amazing Amy	185	’m allowed to clean myself up in a private room in the hospital , and I change into a set of clothes Nick put together for me from the house – jeans with creases from being folded too long , a pretty blouse that smells of dust .

171217	171277	171206	171206	he	272	’m not sure if he did it on purpose , or if I thrust myself onto the blade accidentally – I was so off balance . I remember the club falling to the floor , though , and I looked down and saw my blood from the stab wound pooling over the club . I think I passed out then .
171312	171314	171304	171304	you	0	’ attention ?
171372	171425	171371	171371	I	0	’m sorry , that question was not intended in the least to sound like we are blaming you , we just need to get a full picture here so we can close the investigation and you can get on with your life . Do you want another water , or coffee or something ?
171435	171438	171434	171434	I	0	’m so cold .
171744	171770	171743	171743	I	0	’m sure Nick did want to get rid of it – I do n’t blame him , considering you guys zeroed in on him so quickly .
171815	171884	171814	171814	I	0	’m sure it did n’t feel that odd to him . I mean he could n’t do it at our house , because it ’s a crime scene – who knows if you guys will come back , find something in the ashes . At his dad ’s , he has some discretion . I thought it was a smart move , considering you guys were basically railroading him .
172127	172139	172126	172126	I	0	’m sorry . If you had my history , you ’d understand .
172842	172895	172834	172834	they	5334	’re scrambling to cover their asses .

Reviving the muscle memory of early romance . When I forget – I can sometimes briefly forget who my wife is – I actually like hanging out with her . Or the her she is pretending to be . The fact is , my wife is a murderess who is sometimes really fun . May I give one example ? One night I flew in lobster like the old days , and she pretended to chase me with it , and I pretended to hide , and then we both at the same time made an Annie Hall joke , and it was so perfect , so the way it was supposed to be , that I had to leave the room for a second . My heart was beating in my ears . I had to repeat my mantra : Amy killed a man , and she will kill you if you are not very , very careful . My wife , the very fun , beautiful murderess , will do me harm if I displease her . I find myself jittery in my own house : I will be making a sandwich , standing in the kitchen midday , licking the peanut butter off the knife , and I will turn and find Amy in the same room with me – those quiet little cat feet – and I will quiver . Me , Nick Dunne , the man who used to forget so many details , is now the guy who replays conversations to make sure I did n’t offend , to make sure I never hurt her feelings . I write down everything about her day , her likes and dislikes , in case she quizzes me . I am a great husband because I am very afraid she may kill me .
